Welcome to the Mapping Carifesta Archives project, an initiative to bring together and make accessible the dispersed records of <a href="https://dloc.com/collections/icarifesta">Carifesta</a>, the Caribbean Festival of Arts.
</p>

<h2>Why Mapping?</h2>
<p>

Carifesta, a cultural festival that brings together the arts of the Caribbean, does not have a single, unified archive. Instead, its records are scattered across various institutions, libraries, and personal collections worldwide. This map aims to provide transparency and accessibility to these dispersed records, highlighting the richness and breadth of Carifesta's history.

<h2>Limitations and Scope</h2>

<p>
While digital tools have made it easier to locate and access Carifesta materials, they also have limitations. Not all archives are digitized, and not all digital records are complete or accurate. This map strives to balance the ease of digital access with the depth of physical archives, offering a comprehensive view of the Carifesta archival landscape.
